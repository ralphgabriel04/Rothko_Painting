# Rothko-Style Painting with CSS

## Overview

This project is a tribute to the abstract expressionist painter Mark Rothko, known for his iconic color field paintings. The HTML and CSS code simulates one of Rothko's compositions, emphasizing simplicity and profound emotional resonance through color and form.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the painting, which includes a frame and three colored rectangular divs that represent the painting.
- `styles.css`: Styles the elements in `index.html` to create the Rothko-inspired visual effect. It includes style rules for the canvas layout, color blocks, and various CSS effects like blur, shadows, and subtle rotations.

## Features

- **Responsive Canvas Layout:** Ensures that the artwork is displayed beautifully across different devices.
- **Color Palette:** Inspired by Rothko's work, using deep reds and a vibrant yellow to create a sense of depth and emotion.
- **Blur Effects:** Adds a soft, unfocused quality to the colored rectangles, mimicking the effect of color blending in Rothko's paintings.
- **Visual Depth:** Achieved through box shadows and transforms to give the flat shapes a three-dimensional feel.
- **Subtle Transformations:** Slight rotations and positioning to break the rigidity and add a dynamic quality to the blocks.
